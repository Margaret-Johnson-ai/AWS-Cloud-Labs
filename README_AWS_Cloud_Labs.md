# 🌩️ AWS Cloud Labs Portfolio – Margaret Johnson

Welcome to my AWS Cloud Labs portfolio! This repository contains 10 hands-on AWS projects that demonstrate my skills in serverless architecture, Infrastructure as Code, security, DevOps, and real-world cloud problem solving.

Each project is structured in its own folder with code, architecture diagrams, and documentation.

## 🧠 My AWS Learning Journey

Over the next few months, I’m building a strong AWS portfolio through real-world projects that reflect the challenges faced by cloud engineers, DevOps professionals, and support teams. My goal is to master foundational AWS services, demonstrate troubleshooting and automation skills, and document each solution in a recruiter-friendly format.

I study daily, follow a weekly build-and-review cycle, and post updates regularly on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/margaretjohnson180).
