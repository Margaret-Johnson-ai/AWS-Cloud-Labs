## 🧠 My AWS Learning Journey

I’m building this AWS portfolio while preparing for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. My goal is to show employers my ability to deploy and manage real cloud infrastructure using best practices in identity, automation, and cost awareness.

I post weekly updates on LinkedIn, reflecting on lessons learned, and commit each step here on GitHub.
